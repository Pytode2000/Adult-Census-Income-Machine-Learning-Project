    "This notebook covers the search algorithm used in an environment adapted from the game ***Crossy Road***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms we will be using will be under rule-based-approach which is where by actions will be undertaken based on the rules set by us that is based on game states such as distance to obstacles, speed and size. Crossy Road which is an endless runner is typically trained using reinforcement learning specifically Q-Learning or done using genetic algorithms which we could not use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason traditonal uninformed search algorithms are avoided is due to the fact there is no specific goal state to reach as the goal of the program is to survive as long as possible, unlike uninformed search algorithms like BFS or DFS which are used to find shortest path to goal state. Moreover, in endless runner, the environment is real time and is procedurally generated as the game progress which makes it difficult to build a complete graph or tree of the game environment which is a neccesary step for uninformed search algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Informed search algorithm like greedy best-first search and a* search algorithm is also not suitable for training our agent as they both require evaluating heurestic functions, due to the fact that that the environment is dynamic, the complexity and computational power required to keep on updating the heuristic is very prohibitive further more due to random events and limitation in visibility, it is very difficult to keep on generating heuristic functions to guide it as after a frame, the previous heuristic function becomes irrelevant due to new obstacles being generated and your current position being updated. Furthermore both greedy best-first search algorithm and a* search priortise paths based on their estimated cost to the goal as such this can lead to both algorithm not moving from their original position much which will miss out on effective strategies that is not apparent based on heuristic estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 1st algorithm is based on a rule-based system together with a small incorporation of greedy best-first search. By incorporate greedy best-first search algorithm into our algorithms where by the environment is limited to the vicinity of our agent so that we can identify if we can dodge left or right depending if there is an obstacle in front. For every node, there would be 3 child node/state that it can undertake, being not moving, move left and move right. But the \"graph\" will only consist of depth 2 where by the 3 child node/state will end of in the goal. The weights will be distributed as staying still being the highest weight followed by moving left or right unless there is an obstacle coming up where the weight of staying still will be lowered to allow the best path to be either move left or right.\n",
