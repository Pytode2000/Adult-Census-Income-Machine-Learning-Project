    "The algorithms we will be using will be under rule-based-approach which is where by actions will be undertaken based on the rules set by us that is based on game states such as distance to obstacles, speed and size. Crossy Road which is an endless runner is typically trained using reinforcement learning specifically Q-Learning or done using genetic algorithms which we could not use.\n",
