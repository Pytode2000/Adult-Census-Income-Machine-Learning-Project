## About
This is a mini-project for Nanyang Technology University's SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence where students are grouped and tasked to select a dataset and complete the entire machine-learning pipeline.

Our team has chosen the Adult Census Income dataset (available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult), which analyzes whether adults' incomes are above or below 50 thousand dollars based on a range of features.
